In this assignment I became familiar with hashing techniques and learned to design an efficient domain
name server (DNS) manager program to resolve the given Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of
different domain names (URLs) by using a distributed hash tables mechanism.

The most challenging part for me was to code a rehash function.
The rest was Interesting, because I learned to Index urls and find them in O(n) time complexity,
with the help of HashTables.
